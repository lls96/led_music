# Music Reactive LED Hardware Project
For my rapid prototyping class, I did an individual design project where I made a music reactive LED. I used a Big Sound Sensor, an RGB LED, a push button, and a microcontroller. Please see the description doc for more details on how I made it as well as a schematic. I have also uploaded a video demonstration and the code used (Arduino & C++).
